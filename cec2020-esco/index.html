<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Evolutionary scheduling and combinatorial optimization (ESCO) is an important research area at the interface of artificial intelligence (AI) and operations research (OR). ESCO has attracted the attentions of researchers over the years due to its applicability and interesting computational aspects. Evolutionary Computation (EC) techniques are suitable for these problems since they are highly flexible regarding handling constraints, dynamic changes, and multiple conflicting objectives. With the growth of new technologies and business models, researchers in this field have to continuously face new challenges, which required innovated solution methods.</p>

<h2 id="scope-and-topics">Scope and Topics</h2>

<p>This special session focuses on both practical and theoretical aspects of Evolutionary Scheduling and Combinatorial Optimization. Examples of evolutionary methods include genetic algorithm, genetic programming, evolutionary strategies, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, evolutionary based hyper-heuristics, memetic algorithms. Novel hybrid approaches that combine machine learning and evolutionary computation to solve difficult ESCO problems are highly encouraged. Examples include using machine learning to improve surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms, and designing evolutionary algorithms for reinforcement learning and transfer learning.</p>

<p>We welcome the submissions of quality papers that effectively use the power of EC techniques to solve hard and practical scheduling and combinatorial optimization problems. Papers with rigorous analyses of EC techniques and innovative solutions to handle challenging issues in scheduling and combinatorial optimisation problems are also highly encouraged.</p>

<p><strong>Topics of interest include, but not limited to:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Production scheduling</li>
<li>Timetabling</li>
<li>Vehicle routing</li>
<li>Project scheduling</li>
<li>Transport scheduling</li>
